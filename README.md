[Game Link](https://www.roblox.com/games/13085543769/Price-Point)

Price Point is a game about guessing the prices of a bunch of items from the Roblox marketplace!

## Goals

- Little or loose coupling between components/systems for modularity.
- To be at a comfortable level of challenging - I specifically wanted to use Price Point as a way to experiment with methodology and concepts in a full game, before I take those learnings and work on bigger projects.

## Technical Details

This project is partially managed using [Rojo](https://rojo.space). No game framework - just plain old requiring modules!
