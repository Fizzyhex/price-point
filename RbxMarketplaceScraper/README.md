# Scrape scrape scrape

There are MILLIONS of items on the Roblox marketplace, but for Price Point the focus is (mainly) items published by Roblox themselves. But even then Roblox has uploaded thousands of items - gear, emotes, accessories and more. So that's why I wrote this scraper!

## pip install nothing

The scraper is built purely using proprietary code and Python 3.11's built-in modules.

## Usage

1. Run `PricePointScraper.py`
2. Wait a long ass time
3. The scraper will dump items from the Roblox catalog into json files, based on their categories.
